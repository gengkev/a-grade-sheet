#A Grade Sheet

This project is kind of old by now, and doesn't really work anymore. Here's the description from the old Google Project Hosting page.

---

Instead of another grade sheet application for teachers, this application was written with students in mind. Record your grades, choose the right grading scale, and you're ready.

With this app, you can track how you're doing in school using interactive graphs, and set goals to achieve a certain final grade.

You can keep your grades on our own computer or tablet (using IndexedDB or Web SQL storage) or you can synchronize your data with your Google Account and keep it on Google Docs.
